# Gnome Space Program

Feel free to fork the game and edit whatever you want. You can also start a pull request if you want your changes to be added to the main game.

Some things to note:
A couple textures in the game are from freepbr.com and don't allow commercial use. Look at Gnome-Space-Program/Assets/Textures/000_TEXTURE_CREDIT.txt
